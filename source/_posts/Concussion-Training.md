> Some common sports injuries can occur when engaging in confrontational sports like basketball, therefore it's important to have some knowledge of avoiding and dealing with them. The Michigan Sport-Related Concussion Training Certification satisfies the state-mandated requirement for concussion training in the state of Michigan and can be helpful under certain circumstances. The following are the notes I took during this course.

### Identifying a Concussion

- A concussion, sometimes called a mild traumatic brain injury, can occur from a sudden fall, a blow from another person or a hit from the piece of equipment that causes the brain to move quickly within the skull. This motion changes the way the brain communicates which can lead to changes in how someone thinks or behaves.

#### On-field Signs

- Dazed or stunned
- Displaying the motions that are uncharacteristic of the athlete
- Slowly responding to play calls
- Holding their head
- Difficulty recalling events

#### Concussion symptoms

- Physical
- Cognitive
- Emotional
- Sleep-related

#### Emergency "Red Flags"

- Severe or increasing headache
- Intense neck pain particularly down the middle with weakness or burning into both arms or legs
- Athlete reporting double vision
- Seizing or convulsing body movements
- Loss of consciousness for greater than one minute
- A deteriorating mental state such as going in and out of consciousness
- Repetitive vomiting
- Increasingly combative

#### Michigan's Youth Concussion Law

1. Every athlete and their parent or guardian must provide written informed consent of concussion education materials
2. Each coach, employee or volunteer is required to complete a concussion awareness training program once every three years
3. Any athlete who is suspected of having concussion must be immediately removed from participation
4. Any athlete removed from participation because of a possible concussion cannot return to full sport participation until an appropriate health professional has provided written clearance for the athlete to return to full sport participation

### Remove from Play

- Do not attempt to diagnose a concussion yourself.

#### Goal of Removal

- The goal is not to diagnose a concussion on the sideline, but to remove the athlete from risk, risk of another concussion, or risk of a more serious brain injury.

#### For Athletes

- It's important to know that you don't need to be able to diagnose concussion.
- What we want you to be able to do is recognize signs and symptoms of concussion, so that when a suspected concussion occurs, you'll be able to manage it, and feel calm, and safe during that situation.

#### Responsibilities of Coaches and Parents

1. Make sure they're not participating anymore
2. You need to get him to a medical professional
3. You need to keep them quiet
4. The law in Michigan requires immediate removal of student-athlete whenever there is concern for concussion
5. Before return to full participation, a written authorization from a healthcare provider must be obtained
6. Forms must be kept on file at the school for seven years following the students graduation

### Rest and Rehabilitation

#### The first few Days

1. If red flags symptoms should develop, medical care should be sought immediately
2. Activities that makes symptoms worse should be avoided
3. Activities that put one at an increased risk for concussion should be avoided

#### Reintroduction of Physical School and Work Activities

- Getting restful sleep
- Adequate hydration of 60-80 ounces
- A healthy diet
- Use of electronic devices during recovery from concussion can be undertaken as long as it doesn't markedly worsen symptoms

### Return to Learn and Activity

#### Return to Learn

1. Daily activities
2. School activities
3. Return to school Part-time
4. Return to school Full-time

#### Return to Athletic Activity Stages

1. Symptom-limited activity
2. Light aerobic exercise
3. Sport-specific exercise
4. Non-contact training drills
5. Full contact practice
6. Return to sport

### Long-Term Effects

- It's important to remember that most people have a normal recovery within 30 days of injury
- When prolonged recovery occurs, it's very important to identify the factors that cause the symptoms and to initiate treatment immediately
- Care at a healthcare facility with expertise in concussion can aid in this process
- Management of prolonged recovery should be individualized, and best takes place by those with expertise in concussion care
- Studies do not suggest that there's an increased risk of dementia, depression, or suicide later in life
