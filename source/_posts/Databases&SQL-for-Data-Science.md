> Much of the world's data resides in databases, A working knowledge of databases and SQL is a must to become a data scientist. The emphasis in this course provided by IBM is on hands-on and practical learning. So, I'll try to record how I work with real databases, real data science tools, real-world datasets and eventually, how I create a database instance in the cloud on the following notes I took during this course.

### Introduction to Databases

- Structured Query Language (or SQL) is a powerful language which is used for communicating with and extracting data from databases.
- SQL is among the top 3 skills for a Data Scientist or Data Analysts
- A database is a repository of data, it provides the functionality for adding, modifying and querying data
- RDBMS = Relational database management system
- 5 Basic SQL commands: Create, Insert, Select, Update, Delete
- Cloud databases: Ease of use and access, Scalability & Economics, Disaster recovery
  - IBM Db2, PostgreSQL, Oracle Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon RDS
- DBaaS (Database-as-a-Service) provides users with access to database resources in Cloud without the need for setting up hardware and installing software.

- Relational Model allows for data independence (key advantage)
- Entities are independent objects which have Attributes
  - Entity-Relationship Model (ER-Model): used as a tool to design RDBMS
  - Mapping Entity Diagrams to Tables: Entities become tables, Attributes get translated into columns
- Primary Keys and Foreign Keys: A primary key uniquely identifies a specific row in a table and prevents duplication of data.

### Basic SQL

- Data Definition Language statements (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language statements (DML)

- Data Definition Language (DDL) statements are used to define, change, or drop database objects. 

  - Common DDL statement types include: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `TRUNCATE` and `DROP`

- Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements are used to read and modify data in tables.

  - CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update and Delete
  - Common DML statement types include: `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE`

- `CREATE` and `DROP` tables in the database

  - It is quite common to issue a `DROP` before doing a `CREATE` in test and development scenarios, but if the table does not already exist and you try to drop it, you will see an error like `XXX.YYY` is an undefined name.

  ```mysql
  drop table COUNTRY;  ## If table already exists
  create table COUNTRY(
  	ID int PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  	CCODE char(2) NOT NULL,
  	NAME varchar(60)
  );
  ```

- Use `SELECT` queries to retrieve data from the database

  ```mysql
  select COLUMN1, COLUMN2, ... from TABLE1 ;
  ##  or
  select * from COUNTRY ;
  ## or
  select * from COUNTRY where ID < 5 ;
  ## or
  select * from COUNTRY where CCODE = 'CA';
  ```

- Use `COUNT`, `DISTINCT`, `LIMIT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` to compose and run basic queries

  ```mysql
  -- 0. Drop table INSTRUCTOR in case it already exists
  drop table INSTRUCTOR;
  -- 1. Create table INSTRUCTOR
  CREATE TABLE INSTRUCTOR
    (ins_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, 
     lastname VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL, 
     firstname VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL, 
     city VARCHAR(15), 
     country CHAR(2)
    );
  -- 2A. Insert single row for Rav Ahuja
  INSERT INTO INSTRUCTOR
    (ins_id, lastname, firstname, city, country)
    VALUES 
    (1, 'Ahuja', 'Rav', 'Toronto', 'CA');
  -- 2B. Insert the two rows for Raul and Hima
  INSERT INTO INSTRUCTOR
    VALUES
    (2, 'Chong', 'Raul', 'Toronto', 'CA'),
    (3, 'Vasudevan', 'Hima', 'Chicago', 'US');
  -- 3. Select all rows in the table
  SELECT * FROM INSTRUCTOR;
  -- 3b. Select firstname, lastname and country where city is Toronto
  SELECT firstname, lastname, country from INSTRUCTOR where city='Toronto';
  -- 4. Change the city for Rav to Markham
  UPDATE INSTRUCTOR SET city='Markham' where ins_id=1;
  -- 5. Delete the row for Raul Chong
  DELETE FROM INSTRUCTOR where ins_id=2;
  -- 5b. Retrieve all rows from the table
  SELECT * FROM INSTRUCTOR ;
  ```

### String Patterns, Ranges, Sorting and Grouping

- Using String Patterns and Ranges

  - The `WHERE` clause always requires a predicate, which is a condition that evaluates to true, false or unknown.
  - Use the `LIKE` predicate with string patterns for the search：`WHERE <columnname> LIKE <string pattern>`

  ```mysql
  select F_NAME , L_NAME
  from EMPLOYEES
  where ADDRESS LIKE '%Elgin,IL%' ;
  ```

- Sorting Result Sets

  - `ORDER BY`: Descending order，Specifying Column Sequence Number

    ```mysql
    select F_NAME, L_NAME, DEP_ID 
    from EMPLOYEES
    order by DEP_ID desc, L_NAME desc;
    ```

- Grouping Result Sets

  - `SELECT DISTINCT()` : Eliminating Duplicates
  - `GROUP BY`
  - `HAVING`: Restricting the result set

  ```mysql
  select DEP_ID, COUNT(*) AS "NUM_EMPLOYEES", AVG(SALARY) AS "AVG_SALARY"
  from EMPLOYEES
  group by DEP_ID
  having count(*) < 4
  order by AVG_SALARY;
  ```

### Functions, Sub-Queries, Multiple Tables

- Built-in Database Functions: Using database functions can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be retrieved from the database.

- Aggregate or Column Functions

  - INPUT: Collection of values (e.g. entire column), OUTPUT: Single value
  - `SUM()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `AVG()`

  ```mysql
  select AVG( COST / QUANTITY ) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL = 'Dog';
  ```

- `SCALAR` and `STRING` functions

  - Perform operations on every input value
  - `ROUND()`, `LENGTH()`, `UCASE`, `LCASE`

  ```mysql
  select DISTINCT(UCASE(ANIMAL)) from PETRESCUE;
  select * from PETRESCUE where LCASE(ANIMAL) = 'cat';
  ```

- Date and Time Built-in Functions
  - `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `DAY()`, `DAYOFWEEK()`, `DAYOFYEAR()`, `WEEK()`, `HOUR()`, `MINUTE()`, `SECOND()`
  - Date or Time Arithmetic

  ```mysql
  select SUM(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where DAY(RESCUEDATE)='14';
  select (RESCUEDATE + 3 DAYS) from PETRESCUE;
  select (CURRENT DATE - RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE;
  ```

- Sub-Queries and Nested Selects

  - Sub-Queries cannot evaluate Aggregate functions like `AVG()` in the `WHERE` clause,therefore,use a sub-Select expression
  - Sub-queries in `FROM` clause substitute the `TABLE` name with a sub-query called Derived Tables or Table Expressions.

  ```mysql
  select * from employees where salary > AVG(salary)
  select EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, SALARY from employees where SALARY > (select AVG(SALARY) from employees);
  select EMP_ID, SALARY, ( select AVG(SALARY) from employees ) AS AVG_SALARY from employees ;
  ```

- Working with Multiple Tables

  - Sub-queries

  ```mysql
  select * from employees where DEP_ID IN ( select DEPT_ID_DEP from departments where LOC_ID = 'L0002' );
  select DEPT_ID_DEP, DEP_NAME from departments where DEPT_ID_DEP IN ( select DEP_ID from employees where SALARY > 70000 ) ;
  ```

  - Implicit `JOIN`

  ```mysql
  select * from employees E, departments D where E.DEP_ID = D.DEPT_ID_DEP;
  select E.EMP_ID, D.DEP_NAME from employees E, departments D where E.DEP_ID = D.DEPT_ID_DEP
  ```

  - `JOIN` operators（`INNER JOIN`, `OUTER JOIN`...）

### Accessing databases using Python

- Python ecosystem: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, SciPy

- DB-API (Python Database API): Python's standard API for accessing relational databases.

  - Connection Objects: Database connections, Manage transactions
  - Cursor Objects: Database queries, Scroll through result set, Retrieve results
  - Connection methods: `.cursor()`, `.commit()`, `.rollback()`, `.close()`
  - Cursor methods: `.callproc()`, `.execute()`, `.executemany()`, `.fetchone()`, `.fetchmany()`, `.fetchall()`, `.nextset()`, `.arraysize()`, `.close()`

  ```python
  from dbmodule import connect
  #Create connection object
  Connection = connect('databasename', 'username', 'pswd')
  #Create a cursor object
  Cursor=connection.cursor()
  #Run Queries
  Cursor.execute('select * from mytable')
  Results = cursor.fetchall()
  #Free resources
  Cursor.close()
  Connection.close()
  ```

- Connect to Db2 database (ibm_db API)

  ```python
  import ibm_db
  #Replace the placeholder values with your actual Db2 hostname, username, and password:
  dsn_hostname = "YourDb2Hostname"   # e.g.: "dashdb-txn-sbox-yp-dal09-04.services.dal.bluemix.net"
  dsn_uid = "YourDb2Username"        # e.g. "abc12345"
  dsn_pwd = "YoueDb2Password"      # e.g. "7dBZ3wWt9XN6$o0J"
  dsn_driver = "{IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER}"
  dsn_database = "BLUDB"            # e.g. "BLUDB"
  dsn_port = "50000"                # e.g. "50000" 
  dsn_protocol = "TCPIP"            # i.e. "TCPIP"
  #Create the dsn connection string
  dsn = (
      "DRIVER={0};"
      "DATABASE={1};"
      "HOSTNAME={2};"
      "PORT={3};"
      "PROTOCOL={4};"
      "UID={5};"
      "PWD={6};").format(dsn_driver, dsn_database, dsn_hostname, dsn_port, dsn_protocol, dsn_uid, dsn_pwd)
  #Create database connection
  try:
      conn = ibm_db.connect(dsn, "", "")
      print ("Connected to database: ", dsn_database, "as user: ", dsn_uid, "on host: ", dsn_hostname)
  except:
      print ("Unable to connect: ", ibm_db.conn_errormsg() )
  ```

- Close the connection

  ```python
  ibm_db.close(conn)
  ```

- Creating tables, loading data and querying data

  ```python
  #Lets first drop the table INSTRUCTOR in case it exists from a previous attempt
  dropQuery = "drop table INSTRUCTOR"
  #Now execute the drop statment
  dropStmt = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, dropQuery)
  #Construct the Create Table DDL statement - replace the ... with rest of the statement
  createQuery = "create table INSTRUCTOR(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, fname ...)"
  #Now fill in the name of the method and execute the statement
  createStmt = ibm_db.replace_with_name_of_execution_method(conn, createQuery)
  #Construct the query - replace ... with the insert statement
  insertQuery = "..."
  #execute the insert statement
  insertStmt = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, insertQuery)
  #replace ... with the insert statement that inerts the remaining two rows of data
  insertQuery2 = "..."
  #execute the statement
  insertStmt2 = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, insertQuery2)
  #Construct the query that retrieves all rows from the INSTRUCTOR table
  selectQuery = "select * from INSTRUCTOR"
  #Execute the statement
  selectStmt = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, selectQuery)
  #Fetch the Dictionary (for the first row only) - replace ... with your code
  ...
  #Fetch the rest of the rows and print the ID and FNAME for those rows
  while ibm_db.fetch_row(selectStmt) != False:
     print (" ID:",  ibm_db.result(selectStmt, 0), " FNAME:",  ibm_db.result(selectStmt, "FNAME"))
  updateQuery = "update INSTRUCTOR set CITY='MOOSETOWN' where FNAME='Rav'"
  updateStmt = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, updateQuery))
  ```

- Retrieve data into Pandas

  ```python
  import pandas
  import ibm_db_dbi
  #connection for pandas
  pconn = ibm_db_dbi.Connection(conn)
  #query statement to retrieve all rows in INSTRUCTOR table
  selectQuery = "select * from INSTRUCTOR"
  #retrieve the query results into a pandas dataframe
  pdf = pandas.read_sql(selectQuery, pconn)
  #print just the LNAME for first row in the pandas data frame
  pdf.LNAME[0]
  #print the entire data frame
  pdf
  pdf.shape
  ```

- SQL Magic
  - Cell magics: start with a double `%%` sign and apply to the entire cell
  - Line magics: start with a single `%`  sign and apply to a particular line in a cell
  - `%magicname arguments`
  - `%sql select * from tablename`

### Analyzing data with Python

```python
#Connect to the database
%load_ext sql
%sql ibm_db_sa://
#Store the dataset in a Table
import pandas
chicago_socioeconomic_data = pandas.read_csv('https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/jcxq-k9xf.csv')
%sql PERSIST chicago_socioeconomic_data
%sql SELECT * FROM chicago_socioeconomic_data limit 5;
#How many rows are in the dataset
%sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chicago_socioeconomic_data;
#How many community areas in Chicago have a hardship index greater than 50.0
%sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chicago_socioeconomic_data WHERE hardship_index > 50.0;
#What is the maximum value of hardship index in this dataset
%sql SELECT MAX(hardship_index) FROM chicago_socioeconomic_data;
#Which community area which has the highest hardship index
%sql select community_area_name from chicago_socioeconomic_data where hardship_index = ( select max(hardship_index) from chicago_socioeconomic_data )
#Create a scatter plot using the variables per_capita_income_ and hardship_index
!pip install seaborn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import seaborn as sns
income_vs_hardship = %sql SELECT per_capita_income_, hardship_index FROM chicago_socioeconomic_data;
plot = sns.jointplot(x='per_capita_income_',y='hardship_index', data=income_vs_hardship.DataFrame())
```

### Using JOIN operations to work with multiple tables

- Inner Join

- Outer Join

  - Left Outer Join
  - Right Outer Join
  - Full Outer Join

- HR Database example

  ```sql
  --- Select the names, job start dates, and job titles of all employees who work for the department number 5 ---	
  select E.F_NAME,E.L_NAME, JH.START_DATE, J.JOB_TITLE 
  	from EMPLOYEES as E 
  	INNER JOIN JOB_HISTORY as JH on E.EMP_ID=JH.EMPL_ID 
  	INNER JOIN JOBS as J on E.JOB_ID=J.JOB_IDENT
  	where E.DEP_ID ='5'
  ;
  --- Perform a Left Outer Join on the EMPLOYEES and DEPARTMENT tables and select employee id, last name, department id and department name for all employees ---
  select E.EMP_ID,E.L_NAME,E.DEP_ID,D.DEP_NAME
  	from EMPLOYEES AS E 
  	LEFT OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENTS AS D ON E.DEP_ID=D.DEPT_ID_DEP
  ;	
  --- Re-write the query to have the result set include all the employees but department names for only the employees who were born before 1980. ---
  select E.EMP_ID,E.L_NAME,E.DEP_ID,D.DEP_NAME
  	from EMPLOYEES AS E 
  	LEFT OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENTS AS D ON E.DEP_ID=D.DEPT_ID_DEP 
  	AND YEAR(E.B_DATE) < 1980
  ;
  --- Perform a Full Join on the EMPLOYEES and DEPARTMENT tables and select the First name, Last name and Department name of all employees. ---
  select E.F_NAME,E.L_NAME,D.DEP_NAME
  	from EMPLOYEES AS E 
  	FULL OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENTS AS D ON E.DEP_ID=D.DEPT_ID_DEP
  ;
  --- Re-write Query to have the result set include all employee names but department id and department names only for male employees. ---
  select E.F_NAME,E.L_NAME,D.DEPT_ID_DEP, D.DEP_NAME
  	from EMPLOYEES AS E 
  	FULL OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENTS AS D ON E.DEP_ID=D.DEPT_ID_DEP AND E.SEX = 'M'
  ;
  ```
