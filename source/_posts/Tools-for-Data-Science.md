> In this course provided by IBM, I learned about Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, RStudio IDE, Git, GitHub, and Watson Studio, what each tool is used for, what programming languages they can execute, their features and limitations. With the tools hosted in the cloud on Skills Network Labs, I can now run simple code in Python, R or Scala. The following are the notes I took during this course.

### Languages of Data Science

Python
- General Purpose language with Large standard library
- Scientific computing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib
- For artificial intelligence it has PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras and Scikit-learn
- Python can be used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

R Language
- Python is Open Source, R is Free Software
- Open Source Initiative (OSI) champions open source while the Free Software Foundation (FSF) defines free software
- Open Source is more business focused while Free Software is more focused on a set of values
- R is most often used by statisticians, mathematicians and data miners for developing statistical software, graphing and data analysis
- The array-oriented syntax makes it easier to translate from math to code
- R has become the world's largest repository of statistical knowledge
- Common mathematical operations like matrix multiplication work straight out of the box
- R has stronger object-oriented programming facilities than most statistical computing languages 

SQL (Structured Query Language)
- SQL = 
- SQL was initially developed at IBM, first appeared in 1974
- Useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables
- The SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including clauses, expressions, predicates, queries, and statements
- Knowing SQL will help you do many different jobs in data science, including business and data analyst, and it's a must in data engineering. 
- When performing operations with SQL, you access the data directly ( without any need to copy it beforehand). This can speed up workflow executions considerably.
- SQL is the interpreter between you and the database
- SQL is an American National Standards Institute, or "ANSI," standard, which means if you learn SQL and use it with one database, you will be able to easily apply that SQL knowledge to many other databases.
- MySQL, IBM Db2, PostgreSQL, Apache OpenOffice Base, SQLite, Oracle, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server

Java
- Java is a tried and true general purpose object oriented programming language
- Huge adoption in the enterprise space, designed to be fast and scalable
- Java applications are compiled to bytecode and run on JVM
- Tools include Weka (data mining), Java-ML (ml library), Apache MLlib (scalable ml) and Deeplearning4j
- Hadoop manages data processing and storage for big data applications running in clustered systems

Scala
- Scala is a general purpose programming language that provides support for functional programming
- Designed as an extension to Java, it is inter-operable with Java as it also runs on JVM
- The name Scala comes from "Scalable Language"
- Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides APIs that make parallel jobs easy to write, and an optimized engine that supports general computation graphs.
- Spark includes Shark, which is a query engine; MLlib, for machine learning; GraphX, for graph processing; and Spark Streaming. 
- Apache Spark was designed to be faster than Hadoop

C++
- Another general purpose language, C++ is an extension of C
- Improve processing speed, enables system programming and gives you broader control over the application
- Many organizations rely on C++ to develop programs that feed data to customers in real-time
- TensorFlow is a deep learning library
- MongoDB is a NoSQL database for big data management
- Caffe is a deep learning algorithm repository

Javascript
- A core technology for the WWW, A general purpose language that extended beyond the browser with Node.js and other server side approaches
- TensorFlow.js makes machine learning and deep learning possible in Node.js and in the browser, It is adopted by other open source libraries including brain.js and machinelearn.js
- R-js makes linear algebra possible in Typescript

Julia
- Designed at MIT for high-performance numerical analysis and computational science
- Same speedy development like Python or R while producing programs that run as fast as C or Fortran programs would
- It's compiled, calls C, Go, Java, MATLAB, R, Fortran and Python libraries and has refined parallelism
- A young language with a lot of promise in the data science industry
- JuliaDB is a particularly useful application of Julia for data science. It's a package for working with large persistent data sets.

ggplot(aes(x=disp,y=mpg,),data=mtcars)+geom_point()
# Add a title
ggplot(aes(x=disp,y=mpg,),data=mtcars)+geom_point()+ggtitle("displacement vs miles per gallon")
# change axis name
ggplot(aes(x=disp,y=mpg,),data=mtcars)+geom_point()+ggtitle("displacement vs miles per gallon") + labs(x = "Displacement", y = "Miles per Gallon")
#make vs a factor
mtcars$vs <- as.factor(mtcars$vs)
# create boxplot of the distribution for v-shaped and straight Engine
ggplot(aes(x=vs, y=mpg), data = mtcars) + geom_boxplot()
# Add color to the boxplots to help differentiate
ggplot(aes(x=vs, y=mpg, fill = vs), data = mtcars) +

```

### Github

A version control system allows you to keep track of changes to your documents

Git is free and open source software distributed under the GNU General Public License

Git is a distributed version control system and is accessible anywhere in the world

SSH protocol is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another

Repository contains project folders that are set up for version control

Fork is a copy of a repository

Pull request is the way you request that someone reviews and approves your changes before they become final

Working directory contains the files and subdirectories on your computer that are associated with a Git repository

Basic Git Commands

```bash
git init
git add *
git status
git commit
git reset
git log
git branch
git checkout
git merge
```

Working with Branches

- A branch is a snapshot of your repository to which you can make changes
- Master Branch is the official version of the project, The child branch creates a copy of the master branch
- Edits and changes are made in the child branch. Tests are done to ensure quality before merging to the Master Branch
- Branches allow for simultaneous development and testing by multiple team members 

Pull Requests (PR) are a way of proposing changes to the main branch. Ideally, another team member reviews the changes and approves it to be merged to the Master branch
