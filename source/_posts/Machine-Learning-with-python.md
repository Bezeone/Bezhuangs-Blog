> This course provided by IBM dives into the basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known programming language, Python. In this course, I've learned about the purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world and had a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms. The following are the notes I took during this course.

### Introduction to Machine Learning

#### What is machine learning

- Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives "computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."
- Major machine learning techniques
  - Regression/Estimation: Predicting continuous values
  - Classification: Predicting the item class/category of a case
  - Clustering: Finding the structure of data, summarization
  - Associations: Associating frequent co-occurring items/events
  - Anomaly detection: Discovering abnormal and unusual cases
  - Sequence mining: Predicting next events, click-stream (Markov Model, HMM)
  - Dimension Reduction: Reducing the size of data (PCA)
  - Recommendation systems: Recommending items
- Difference between artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning
  - AI components: Computer Vision, Language Processing, Creativity, etc
  - Machine learning: Classification, Clustering, Neural Network, etc
  - Revolution in ML: Deep learning
