> Despite the recent increase in computing power and access to data over the last couple of decades, our ability to use the data within the decision making process is either lost or not maximized at all too often, we don't have a solid understanding of the questions being asked and how to apply the data correctly to the problem at hand. This course provided by IBM shares a methodology that can be used within data science, to ensure that the data used in problem solving is relevant and properly manipulated to address the question at hand. The following are the notes I took during this course.

### Data Science Methodologies

- Methodology: a system of methods used in a particular area of study.
- CRISP-DM: the Cross Industry Process for Data Mining methodology.
  - The CRISP-DM methodology is a process aimed at increasing the use of data mining over a wide variety of business applications and industries. 
  - The intent is to take case specific scenarios and general behaviors to make them domain neutral. 
  - CRISP-DM is comprised of six steps with an entity that has to implement in order to have a reasonable chance of success.
  - Business Understanding、Data Understanding、Data Preparation、Modeling、Evaluation、Deployment
  - CRISP-DM is a highly flexible and cyclical model. Flexibility is required at each step along with communication to keep the project on track. 
  - At any of the six stages, it may be necessary to revisit an earlier stage and make changes. The key point of this process is that it’s cyclical.

### From Problem to Approach

- Business Understanding
- Analytic Approach

### From Requirements to Collection

- Data Requirements
- Data Collection

### From Understanding to Preparation 

- Data Understanding
- Data understanding is iterative
- Data Preparation

### From Modeling to Evaluation

- Modeling
- Evaluation

### From Deployment to Feedback

- Deployment
- The refined model must be redeployed.
- This process should be repeated as often as necessary.
- Feedback
