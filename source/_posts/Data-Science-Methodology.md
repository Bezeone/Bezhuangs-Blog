> Despite the recent increase in computing power and access to data over the last couple of decades, our ability to use the data within the decision making process is either lost or not maximized at all too often, we don't have a solid understanding of the questions being asked and how to apply the data correctly to the problem at hand. This course provided by IBM shares a methodology that can be used within data science, to ensure that the data used in problem solving is relevant and properly manipulated to address the question at hand. The following are the notes I took during this course.

### Data Science Methodologies

- Methodology: a system of methods used in a particular area of study.
- CRISP-DM: the Cross Industry Process for Data Mining methodology.
  - The CRISP-DM methodology is a process aimed at increasing the use of data mining over a wide variety of business applications and industries. 
  - The intent is to take case specific scenarios and general behaviors to make them domain neutral. 
  - CRISP-DM is comprised of six steps with an entity that has to implement in order to have a reasonable chance of success.
  - Business Understanding、Data Understanding、Data Preparation、Modeling、Evaluation、Deployment
  - CRISP-DM is a highly flexible and cyclical model. Flexibility is required at each step along with communication to keep the project on track. 
  - At any of the six stages, it may be necessary to revisit an earlier stage and make changes. The key point of this process is that it’s cyclical.

### From Problem to Approach

- Business Understanding
  - Establishing a clearly defined question starts with understanding the goal of the person asking the question
  - Seek clarification (where is the goal) -> Support the goal -> Get stakeholder "buy-in" and support
  - Case Study: Apply concepts, Define Goals and objectives, Pilot project kickoff, Identify the business requirements
- Analytic Approach
  - Once a strong understanding of the question is established, the analytic approach can be selected. This means identifying what type of patterns will be needed to address the question most effectively
  - The correct approach depends on business requirements for the model
  - If the question is to determine probabilities of an action, Use a predictive model 
  - If the question is to show relationships, Use a descriptive model
  - if the question requires a yes/no answer, Use a classification model
  - It is only when the problem to be addressed is defined, that the appropriate analytic approach for the problem can be selected in the context of the business requirements
  - Case Study: Decision tree classification (Predictive model)

### From Requirements to Collection

- Data Requirements
  - The Data Requirements stage of the data science methodology involves identifying the necessary data content, formats and sources for initial data collection.
  - Prior to undertaking the data collection and data preparation stages of the methodology, it's vital to define the data requirements for decision-tree classification. This includes identifying the necessary data content, formats and sources for initial data collection
  - Case Study: Select the cohort, Define the data
- Data Collection
  - Once the data ingredients are collected, then in the data collection stage, the data scientist will have a good understanding of what they will be working with
  - Techniques such as descriptive statistics and visualization can be applied to the data set, to assess the content, quality, and initial insights about the data. Gaps in data will be identified and plans to either fill or make substitutions will have to be made
  - When collecting data, it is alright to defer decisions about unavailable data, and attempt to acquire it at a later stage
  - Case Study: Gather available data, Merge data

### From Understanding to Preparation 

- Data Understanding
  - Descriptive statistics: Univariate statistics, Pairwise correlations, Histogram
  - Data quality: Missing value, Invalid or misleading values
  - Iterative data collection and understanding: Refined definition of "CHF admission"
  - Data understanding is iterative; you learn more about your data the more you study it
  - Sorting data is not part of the Data Understanding stage
- Data Preparation
  - Cleansing data
  - Transforming data
  - Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make the machine learning algorithms work
  - Feature engineering is critical when machine learning tools are being applied to analyze the data
  - The Data Preparation stage is in fact the most time-consuming phase of a data science project
  - Using training sets

### From Modeling to Evaluation

- Modeling
  - Descriptive Analytics
  - Predictive Analytics
  - A training set is used to build a predictive model
  - Understand the question at hand -> Select an analytic approach or method to solve the problem -> Obtain, understand, prepare and model the data
- Evaluation
  - Diagnostic measures: Predictive model, Descriptive model, Statistical significance
  - Diagnostic tool for classification model evaluation
    - Classification model performance 
    - True-Positive Rate `vs` False-Positive Rate
    - Optimal model at maximum separation
  - Model evaluation can have two main phases: a diagnostic measures phase and statistical significance testing
- The purpose of statistical significance tests: Modeling and evaluation are iterative processes

### From Deployment to Feedback

- Deployment
  - Understand the results
  - Gather application requirements
  - After the model is evaluated and the data scientist is confident it will work, it is deployed and put to the ultimate test
  - The refined model must be redeployed
  - This process should be repeated as often as necessary
- Feedback
  - Assessing model performance
  - Refine model: Review and refine intervention actions
  - Redeployment: Continue modeling, deployment, feedback and refinement throughout the life of the Intervention program
  - The data science methodology is highly iterative, ensuring the refinement at each stage in the game
