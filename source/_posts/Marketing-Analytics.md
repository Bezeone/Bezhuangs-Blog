- Revenue Premium
  - Equity = Annual revenue premium \* (1 + discount rate) / (1 + discount rate - stability factor)
  - Annual revenue premium = Revenue premium - Additional variable cost

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

- Both backward looking and forward looking
- Net present value (NPV)
- CLV = (Gross margin - Detention spending) \* (1 + discount rate) / (1+discount rate - retention rate)

### Price Elasticity

- PED = (Change in Sales / Change in Price) `*` (Price / Sales)
- Coefficient \* Average price/ Average sales
- Measures the impact of a change in price on sales
- Enhances your ability to utilize regressions
