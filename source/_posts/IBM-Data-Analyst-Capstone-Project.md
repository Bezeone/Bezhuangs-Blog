> In this course provided by IBM, I will assume the role of an Associate Data Analyst who has recently joined the organization and be presented with a business challenge that requires data analysis to be performed on real-world datasets. The capstone project will culminate with a presentation of your data analysis report, with an executive summary for the various stakeholders in the organization. I believe this project is a great opportunity to showcase Data Analytics skills, and demonstrate proficiency to potential employers. The following are the notes I took during this course.
